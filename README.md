# krye.io &bull; [![dependency status](https://deps.rs/repo/github/rye/krye.io/status.svg)](https://deps.rs/repo/github/rye/krye.io)

This repository houses the templates, content, and such corresponding to my personal website, which are deployed in CI to GitHub Pages.
The crate included consists of template-rendering scripts that automatically generate the contents and publish them.

I prefer to run this site as a static site with API calls as necessary, to an external endpoint.
(`api.krye.io`, which accepts a variety of routes and parameters.)
